This started as experiment to look at using the playpool chart idea in different ways.

This was inspired by [Luke Mastin's vertical timeline of Western philosophers](http://www.philosophybasics.com/general_timeline.html) and the names and dates are taken from [the historical section of Mastin's _The Basics of Philosophy_ website](http://www.philosophybasics.com/historical.html).

I wrote about developing this and the problems I encountered in [my blog post called "Problems in the philosophers' playpool"](http://guypursey.com/blog/201610242200-problems-in-philosophers-playpool).
